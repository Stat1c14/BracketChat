# [UNMAINTAINED] BracketChat

## Description

BracketChat is designed to allow code to be shared amongst large groups of people instantaneously. It is meant to be used in classroom/conference settings to quickly exchange code snippets between participants without having to share personal information. It was built using Node.js and the socket.io library to asynchronously transport data between the end users and the server. This process occurs seemlessly and allows for a high number of simultaneous connections as well as near-instant message delivery times.

## Install

Install is same as any node.js install. After installing Node, just run
```
npm install
```
to install BracketChat and fetch any necessary modules.
